I'm David Pevzner, a high school student fascinated by theoretical physics, Quantum Field Theory in particular. I want to use this website to display various original notes/derivations/calculations done by me. Some of these derivations currently cannot be found anywhere else online. Also, I love evaluating crazy definite integrals via obscure methods, so expect some of those.
