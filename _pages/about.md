Welcome to my website, I'm David Pevzner, a high school student fascinated by theoretical physics(Quantum Field Theory in particular). I want to use this website to display some of my various original notes/derivations/calculations based on topics ranging from QFT and quantum mechanics to evaluating definite integrals via complex methods. I hope you will find these resources helpful, and thank you for visiting my website. If you notice any errors/discrepancies, please let me know; my email is dpevzner17@gmail.com.
